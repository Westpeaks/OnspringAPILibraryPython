# OnspringAPILibraryPython

This library builds on the Python Requests library to further abstract requests and make working with the Onspring API more accessible via Python. It provides a simplified path for Onspring customers to integrate with an organization's OnSpring instance.

## Installation

To install and use the library, clone this repo and reference two main files, the onspring_api_library_v2.py file and client_code_examples.py.

_Important_

- The onspring_api_library.py contains a class for all of the requests. The requests are built using a seris of constructors and then utillized via a series of prebuilt methods. This allows the developer to make requests using much less syntax.
- What must be obtained prior to the utilization of this library is an API key from an Onspring instance.

## Obtaining an API Key

Interacting with the Onspring API requires a generated key. Keys can be generated by an Onspring user who has been granted the appropriate permissions. This typically an admin user. To generate a key:

1. In Onspring, navigate to Administration> Security> API Keys.
2. On the list page, select to create a new key or click on an existing one.
3. On the details page, expand the _Developer Information_ section. Copy the _X-ApiKey Header_.
